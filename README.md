# Astral Cheese Defenders

A 3D factory survival game with Super-Mario-Galaxy-style physics.

## Running

To try out ACD, you have to host `index.html` through a web server. The easeiest way to do this (assuming you have the latest NodeJS installed) is to navigate to the project directory and run:

    npx http-server

This will give you an IP address that you can open in a browser and play the game.
